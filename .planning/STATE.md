# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-10)

**Core value:** The recipe brain -- an AI agent that remembers everything about your meals and reasons over that knowledge to help you plan.
**Current focus:** v1.2 Onboarding and Feedback -- Phase 15 (Users, Households, and Invites)

## Current Position

Phase: 15 of 18 (Users, Households, and Invites)
Plan: 1 of 2 complete
Status: Executing
Last activity: 2026-02-11 -- Completed 15-01 Identity Data Layer

Progress: [█░░░░░░░░░] 10% (v1.2)

## Performance Metrics

**v1.0 Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 30
- Average duration: 2.8 min
- Total execution time: 83 min

**v1.1 Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 10
- Average duration: 6 min
- Total execution time: 55 min

**v1.2 Velocity:**
- 15-01: 4 min (2 tasks, 12 files)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
All v1.0 and v1.1 decisions documented with outcomes.

**Phase 15-01:**
- Admin household_id = admin telegram_id (Phase 16 chatId migration compatibility)
- Repository uses standalone function exports (not factory), takes sqlite as first param
- Invite tokens: crypto.randomBytes(24).toString('base64url') -- 32-char, zero new deps

### Key Research Findings (v1.2)

- Zero new npm dependencies needed for v1.2
- Core challenge: chatId -> householdId migration (339 occurrences, 47 files)
- Phase 15+16 tightly coupled -- half-migrated state is dangerous, execute in rapid succession
- FTS5 triggers survive ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN but verify after migration
- grammY ctx.match provides deep link token natively
- Onboarding state stored in SQLite (not grammY sessions plugin)

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

None.
